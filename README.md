# Banking-Dashboard
This project presents a banking dashboard that visualizes key metrics like loans, deposits, and client data. It helps analyze trends by gender, income, and occupation, enabling banks to make informed decisions and personalize services through interactive data insights.

## INTRODUCTION
In today’s data-driven financial environment, banks must harness data visualization tools to gain actionable insights and make informed decisions. This banking dashboard is designed to provide a comprehensive overview of client activity, loan distributions, and deposit patterns. It allows stakeholders to analyze key metrics like total deposits, loans, account types, client demographics, and more—all in an interactive and visually engaging manner.

## PROBLEM STATEMENTS
Banks often manage vast amounts of financial data across different departments and client types. However, raw data alone lacks immediate meaning unless organized and visualized effectively. The main challenge is to translate this raw banking data into meaningful insights that can guide strategic decision-making—particularly in understanding client behavior, income trends, loan allocations, and deposit distribution by gender, occupation, and relationship categories.

## POWER BI DASHBOARD:

## INSIGHTS:
1.Mid-income clients contribute the highest share of both loans (942.49M) and deposits (1.09B).

2.Private banking customers dominate in both loan and deposit amounts.

3.Business lending is the largest loan category at 2.60 billion.

4.One nationality group holds over 43% of both total loans and deposits.

5.Accountants and database admins show higher loan activity; structural workers lead in deposits.

## CONCLUSION
This dashboard effectively transforms banking data into a powerful decision-making tool. With interactive filters and clear visual summaries, bank managers can identify trends across demographics and income levels. For example, mid-income clients dominate both deposits and loans, and certain occupations reflect higher banking activity. By pinpointing these insights, banks can tailor services, allocate resources wisely, and enhance customer satisfaction and profitability.
